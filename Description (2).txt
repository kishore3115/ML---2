Customer Segmentation Using K-Means for Retail Analytics:
In retail analytics, businesses analyze customer behavior to create better marketing strategies. By using K-Means clustering, we segment customers based on Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score to identify distinct groups.
How We Do It:
1. Collect & Prepare Data – We use a dataset containing customer details like Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.
2. Determine the Number of Clusters – Using the Elbow Method, we find the best number of customer groups by analyzing how the variance within clusters decreases.
3. Apply K-Means Clustering – We group customers based on their similarities.
4. Evaluate the Segments – We use metrics like Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Score, and Calinski-Harabasz Score to measure how well the clustering works.
5. Visualize & Interpret Results – We plot the clusters to understand customer behavior better.
What We Get (Customer Groups):
Premium Shoppers – High-income, high-spending customers
Frequent Budget Shoppers – Low-income customers who spend often
Occasional Shoppers – Low-income, low-spending customers
Young Customers – Students and young professionals with mixed spending habits
How This Helps Businesses:
1.Targeted Marketing – Send personalized offers to different customer groups
2.Improved Customer Loyalty – Design loyalty programs for high-value customers
3.Optimized Business Strategies – Make better pricing and product placement decisions
By using data-driven insights, businesses can better understand their customers and improve customer engagement.
